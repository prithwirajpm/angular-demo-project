1. module : used to hold multiple component and helps import packages to design page Root Module : App module
2. Component : is apart of UI , consist of HTML,CSS and ts file and ts file and its selector to use it in another page - Root Component : AppComponent
3. Decoration : to add Meta data (data inside another data), Indicate using @

5: Data Binding : Data sharing within a Component
        - one way binding : 
            -component (ts file) to view (html file)
                - Sting Interpolation : use  {{property-name}} in html page
                - property Binding : bind class property with html tag attributes - [attributes] = "property"
            -View (html file) to component (it file)
